<span class="carol-gothic">The Raven</span>
<p><span class="carol2">By Edgar Allan Poe</span></p>
<p>
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</br>
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-</br>
Only this, and nothing more."</br>

<p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow</br>
From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-</br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-</br>
Nameless here for evermore.</br>

<p>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</br>
Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</br>
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,</br>
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-</br>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-</br>
This it is, and nothing more."</br>

<p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</br>
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</br>
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</br>
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</br>
That I scarce was sure I heard you"- here I opened wide the door;-</br>
Darkness there, and nothing more.</br>

<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,</br>
fearing,</br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;</br>
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</br>
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"</br>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"-</br>
Merely this, and nothing more.</br>

<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</br>
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</br>
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:</br>
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-</br>
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-</br>
'Tis the wind and nothing more."</br>

<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</br>
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;</br>
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</br>
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-</br>
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-</br>
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</br>

<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</br>
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.</br>
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no</br>
craven,</br>
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-</br>
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"</br>
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</br>

<p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</br>
Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;</br>
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</br>
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-</br>
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</br>
With such name as "Nevermore."</br>

<p>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</br>
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</br>
Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-</br>
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown</br>
before-</br>
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."</br>
Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</br>

<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</br>
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,</br>
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</br>
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-</br>
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</br>
Of 'Never- nevermore'."</br>

<p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,</br>
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and</br>
door;</br>
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</br>
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-</br>
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore</br>
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</br>

<p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</br>
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;</br>
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</br>
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,</br>
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,</br>
She shall press, ah, nevermore!</br>

<p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</br>
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.</br>
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he</br>
hath sent thee</br>
Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!</br>
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"</br>
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</br>

<p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or</br>
devil!-</br>
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</br>
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-</br>
On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-</br>
Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!"</br>
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</br>

<p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or</br>
devil!</br>
By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-</br>
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</br>
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-</br>
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."</br>
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</br>

<p>"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked,</br>
upstarting-</br>
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!</br>
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</br>
Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!</br>
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my</br>
door!"</br>
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</br>

<p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</br>
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</br>
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,</br>
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the</br>
floor;</br>
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</br>
Shall be lifted- nevermore!</p>
